### Running on iOS

1. If you haven't already, install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)
2. In this ios directory, run `pod install`
3. Open LYN.xcworkspace in XCode
4. Clean the build (cmd + shift + k)
4. Run the app on a simulator or device

### Running on Android

### Logging into the application

Note that the registration process for LyfLynks is a manual process that includes an interview with the user prior to activating their account. Due to this, the API database is seeded with pre-registered users that you can use to interact with the application. One such user is:

- username: billyj
- password: bjpassword

This user belongs to two accounts that you should be able to select from after logging in.

## App Architecture

### /api
The /api directory is for our Node.js API wrapper. It allows us to abstract
AJAX requests to the REST API, which we can use as recognizable functions in Redux.

### /components
Contains React components, which provide basic functionality.

### /screans
Screens resemble components, however, they represent an entire page in the application (e.g. Activity Log).

### /Navigation
The navigationStack.js file specifies all navigation actions between screens using `react-navigation`. The
three available navigation types are DrawerNavigator, StackNavigator, and TabNavigator. 

### App.js
The App.js file is the root of our App. It currently wraps our Navigation component with Redux.

## Styling components
Component styles are contained within each component definition and applied in-line.
However, to make the process of recoloring the UI simple and consistent, the /styles/colors.js
file is imported into several components. This allows us to define a set of common colors for
buttons, headers, text, etc. that can be reused across all of our components. Wherever it makes sense,
reusable styles should be stored in /styles.

## Running Tests
Tests are written in /\__test\__. Jest watches for changes to this file and
automatically runs tests on save. To start Jest, run `yarn test` in a
terminal.
